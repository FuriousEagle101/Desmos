Euclidean Space,https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f0fgsglxfr,2024-01-15,802445,0,1,0,0,0,0,"This is a fully-playable video game programmed entirely in Desmos (with the exception of the asteroid and space ship images being created in MS Paint). It even has a switch you can flip to play on the Desmos mobile app. Seriously. Try it out. The game is basically a space-themed flappy bird with extra lives and a gradually increasing difficulty. Think you can get to 100 points? This was only the 10th graph on this page, and it's still unbeat in awesomeness. This was also the first project where I really realized what Desmos can do, including the neat fact that it is Turing complete. Background music and space ship design by Aiden Chiasson."
Conway's Game of Life,https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wl2ixodafo,2024-12-02,8465,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Arguably the coolest Turing complete system (well, except maybe Desmos) ever created. This was on my Desmos bucket list ever since I found out Desmos is Turing complete. I suppose the next thing to do is to make Desmos on Conway's Game of Life. That might be a tad more difficult, though."
Mandelbrot Set 2.0,https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vpibnxiqsz,2024-07-11,2169,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Version two of this fractal had several improvements which, in combination with the fact that the Mandelbrot set is simply awesome, has given this graph a very high awesomeness score. In contrast to version one, this graph uses actual recursion, making it way more efficient and giving it way fewer equations. A better rainbow system was also incorporated along with a variable recursion depth."
Desmos Demos Data,https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jt1m80ckxe,2025-08-11,8730,0,0,0,0,0,0,"This is a snapshot of the graph found in the Data tab of this page from when it was first created. The funny thing is, originally, I was going to embed a Power BI dashboard into this page to show all the Desmos Demos data visuals. What I didn't know was that to do this, you need a paid ""pro"" account, so I had to find an alternative data visualization tool. And what better tool for summarizing data about Desmos graphs than Desmos itself?"

Hilbert Curve,https://www.desmos.com/calculator/4on9ebg9wh,2025-06-05,2481,0,0,0,1,0,0,"This is a space-filling curve, meaning that the limit of this curve will hit every point in the square, even points like (pi/4,pi/4) which will never be hit by any finite level Hilbert curve. In simple words, it means it will keep spreading out to cover more space. Most people count Hilbert curves as fractals, though by some definitions it is not."

Mandelbrot Set 3.0,https://www.desmos.com/calculator/btkysupv2j,2024-12-01,1826,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Despite being the third version of this fractal, it is actually slightly worse performance-wise, which is why it's much lower on the awesomeness scale. For this version, I used the (at the time) new complex mode to replace the pointwise opperations with more elegant, but slower, complex-number-wise opperations."
Newton's Fractal 2.0,https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nfyov4bpry,2025-04-07,1668,0,0,0,1,0,0,Version two of this graph is simply a more efficient version of Newtons fractal.

Before this, I had messed around with random Desmos functions and how they could be used to create neat patterns, but I had never tried to make anything worth sharing. Then, nearing Haloween, my math teacher gave us a fun assignment to create something Haloween-esque in Desmos. This was the result."
